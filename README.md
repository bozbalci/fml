# fml
This repository contains personal notes kept in plain text.

fml stands for **f**ork **m**y **l**ife.

## Why?
Keeping things in plain text helps me to work with them efficently using certain command-line utilities such as `column`, `cut`, `paste`, `join`, `sort`, `uniq`, `vim`, `awk` and many other scripts I write.

I manage these notes using a version control system because it helps me track my progress and synchronize my notes throughout my devices.
